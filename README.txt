I have created an Enum called Direction, inside are the directions based of a compass; West, East etc.

I created an abstract class for characters, as it can be reused, for multiple characters.
The class Player, will extend Character as it contains player based methods and variables which are shared.

I have created a locations class for the locations, using an array, aswell as a brief description of each location.
I have use collections for Enemys and Items, in order to store them at a later time.
